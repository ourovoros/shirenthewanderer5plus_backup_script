Steam userdata backup tool Userdata backup tool for Steam. Backs up the Remote folder in the folder with the specified SteamID and application ID, and ZIP compresses them in the same hierarchy. There is also a restore function. Created for use with roguelike games and other games where Autosave is a prerequisite and failure cannot be undone.
